A tiny sample project to show the Spring Boot DevTools problem described https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/4266[here].

Steps to reproduce:

1. `git clone https://github.com/olivergierke/spring-boot-devtools-sample`
2. `cd spring-boot-devtools-sample`
3. `mvn clean install`
4. Import the `devtools-sample-app` module as Maven project into your IDE.
5. Run `Application.java`.

To see the difference:

6. Import the `devtools-sample-lib` module into your IDE.
7. Make sure Maven is set up to resolve dependencies from workspace projects.
8. Run `Application.java` again and see it bootstrap successfully.

I'd love to be able to declare the `devtools-sample-lib` to be part of my overall application, e.g. by providing a list of base packages whose types could then be included in the restartable class loader.
